## Download dataset

With [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed, you can download the dataset by : 
```
git clone https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset
cd PlantVillage-Dataset
```

Or you can download specific folders through [svn](https://subversion.apache.org/) by replacing `<folderYouWant>` with the appropriate path:
```
svn checkout https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset/trunk/<folderYouWant>
```
For example, if you want to download the folder `raw/color/Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles)`, do it like so:
```
svn checkout https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset/trunk/raw/color/Grape___Esca_\(Black_Measles)

* `segmented` : RGB images with just the leaf segmented and color corrected.
